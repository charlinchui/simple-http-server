# RUBY - RAILS IMPLEMENTATION

Ruby on Rails (Rails) is a web framework for building applications in Ruby, following MVC principles and emphasizing convention over configuration. Each project comes with its own instance of SQLite for database management. Rails ended up being surprisingly easy, making the development fast and comprehensive. Would recommend to beginers or for prototyping/POCs.

#### **Development Speed** 10/10
#### **Application Performance** 2/10
#### **Code Charm & Tidiness** 6/10
#### **Ease of installation** 5/10
#### **Best**: Really easy to implement, code is easy to understand even for beginners, code is well organized, development is fast. Integrated SQLite instance, autogenerated Dockerfiles for easy Dockerization. Easy CLI.
#### **Worst**: Ruby syntax is ugly. Performance is not good. Had to hack my way through table joins. Installation was not smooth at first (was not hard, just not smooth because I had an older version of Ruby). Got overwhelmed after project creation -> Too many Files and Folders.

### **Overall: 5.5/10**
