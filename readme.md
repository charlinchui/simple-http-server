# Simple HTTP Server (CRUD App) in Multiple Languages

## Introduction
Greetings! 👋 I'm Charlie, a Junior Full Stack Developer specializing in JavaScript/TypeScript development in my day job. Currently, I'm immersed in an exciting project—an evolving CRUD application spanning various programming languages. This endeavor is fueled by my passion for continuous learning and the sheer enjoyment of coding.

## Purpose of the Project

The goal is to create a basic HTTP server that performs CRUD operations on Quotes and Authors in a database. Through this project, I want to explore different programming languages to understand their strengths and challenges in building such applications. Additionally, I'm on a quest to find which language I enjoy using the most. This journey is as much about learning as it is about uncovering the distinctive features and individual traits of each language.
